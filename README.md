# StARtNight
StARtNight is a mobile game developed as an university project in a team of three people. The idea was to build an application that combined astronomy with a small but engaging game.
The application opens with a starry dome. The stars reflect their position in the real sky, according to the player's geographical coordinates. This has been done by my colleagues using a real database and transferring the measurements in a way that them could be manipulated. The dome is interactive and the purpose of this part is to show the different constellations and their names.
The game part, which I took care of, wants to make the most out of the augmented reality technology. The task is simple: catch all the stars that have fallen from the sky. The fun is in the fact that the player has to physically walk in the world in order to get close enough to the star and catch it. It can be seen as a hide and seek game with AR.
The mapping of the physical walk of the player in a movement in the game has been developed using Machine Learning techniques.
N.B. The 3D objects, animations and music have been downloaded online.

Feel free to download and try it yourself!
